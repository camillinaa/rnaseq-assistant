def execute_sql_query(sql_query: str) -> pd.Dataframe
    """This method connects to the database, executes the sql query and returns the dataframe"""
</function>


Update this initial code:
```python
# TODO: import the required dependencies
import pandas as pd

# Write code here

# Declare result var: 
type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot"). Examples: { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." } or { "type": "number", "value": 125 } or { "type": "dataframe", "value": pd.DataFrame({...}) } or { "type": "plot", "value": "temp_chart.png" }

```



### QUERY
 what is the expression of CATG00000000004.1 in the pma24 samples?

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.


Generate python code and return full updated code:

The user asked the following question:
### QUERY
 what is the expression of CATG00000000004.1 in the pma24 samples?

You generated the following Python code:
import pandas as pd
sql_query = 'SELECT * FROM table_06e71d5c8f207b1f32443a2f663431df WHERE gene_name = "CATG00000000004.1"'
df = execute_sql_query(sql_query)
pma24_samples = df.filter(regex='pma24')
result = {'type': 'dataframe', 'value': pma24_samples}
result

However, it resulted in the following error:

The user asked the following question:
### QUERY
 what is the expression of CATG00000000004.1 in the pma24 samples?

You generated the following Python code:
import pandas as pd
sql_query = 'SELECT * FROM table_06e71d5c8f207b1f32443a2f663431df WHERE gene_name = "CATG00000000004.1"'
df = execute_sql_query(sql_query)
pma24_samples = df.filter(regex='pma24')
result = {'type': 'dataframe', 'value': pma24_samples}
result

However, it resulted in the following error:

The user asked the following question:
### QUERY
 what is the expression of CATG00000000004.1 in the pma24 samples?

You generated the following Python code:
import pandas as pd
sql_query = 'SELECT * FROM table_06e71d5c8f207b1f32443a2f663431df WHERE gene_name = "CATG00000000004.1"'
df = execute_sql_query(sql_query)
pma24_samples = df.filter(regex='pma24')
result = {'type': 'dataframe', 'value': pma24_samples}
result

However, it resulted in the following error:

Update this initial code:
```python
# TODO: import the required dependencies
import pandas as pd

# Write code here

# Declare result var: 
type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot"). Examples: { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." } or { "type": "number", "value": 125 } or { "type": "dataframe", "value": pd.DataFrame({...}) } or { "type": "plot", "value": "temp_chart.png" }

```



### QUERY
 what is the expression of CATG00000000004.1 for _pma24_ compared to _pma96_?

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.


Generate python code and return full updated code:

def execute_sql_query(sql_query: str) -> pd.Dataframe
    """This method connects to the database, executes the sql query and returns the dataframe"""
</function>


Update this initial code:
```python
# TODO: import the required dependencies
import pandas as pd

# Write code here

# Declare result var: 
type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot"). Examples: { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." } or { "type": "number", "value": 125 } or { "type": "dataframe", "value": pd.DataFrame({...}) } or { "type": "plot", "value": "temp_chart.png" }

```



### QUERY
 which genes are differentially expressed?

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.


Generate python code and return full updated code:

The user asked the following question:
### QUERY
 which genes are differentially expressed?

You generated the following Python code:
import pandas as pd
sql_query = "SELECT gene_name, Significance FROM table_aa46becb7fdcb4e370e7817206649059 WHERE Significance = 'down' OR Significance = 'up'"
df = execute_sql_query(sql_query)
result = {'type': 'dataframe', 'value': df}

However, it resulted in the following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):

The user asked the following question:
### QUERY
 which genes are differentially expressed?

You generated the following Python code:
import pandas as pd
table_aa46becb7fdcb4e370e7817206649059 = table_aa46becb7fdcb4e370e7817206649059.replace('\t', ',')
sql_query = "SELECT gene_name, Significance FROM table_aa46becb7fdcb4e370e7817206649059 WHERE Significance = 'down' OR Significance = 'up'"
df = execute_sql_query(sql_query)
result = {'type': 'dataframe', 'value': df}

However, it resulted in the following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/miniconda3/envs/omics_agent/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pandasai/core/code_execution/code_executor.py", line 29, in execute

  File "<string>", line 2, in <module>
NameError: name 'table_aa46becb7fdcb4e370e7817206649059' is not defined

The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/miniconda3/envs/omics_agent/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pandasai/agent/base.py", line 169, in execute_with_retries

    raise CodeExecutionError("Code execution failed") from e
pandasai.exceptions.CodeExecutionError: Code execution failed


Fix the python code above and return the new python code but the code generated should use execute_sql_query function

# Write code here

# Declare result var: 
type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot"). Examples: { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." } or { "type": "number", "value": 125 } or { "type": "dataframe", "value": pd.DataFrame({...}) } or { "type": "plot", "value": "temp_chart.png" }

```



### QUERY
 which genes are differentially expressed?

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.


Generate python code and return full updated code:

The user asked the following question:
### QUERY
 which genes are differentially expressed?

You generated the following Python code:
import pandas as pd
sql_query = """
SELECT gene_name 
FROM table_aa46becb7fdcb4e370e7817206649059 
WHERE Significance = 'down'
"""
df = execute_sql_query(sql_query)
result = {'type': 'dataframe', 'value': df}

However, it resulted in the following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/miniconda3/envs/omics_agent/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pandasai/agent/base.py", line 136, in _execute_local_sql_query

duckdb.duckdb.BinderException: Binder Error: Referenced column "Significance" not found in FROM clause!
Candidate bindings: "gene_name	baseMean	log2FoldChange	pvalue	padj	Significance	Geneid	Chr	Start	End	Strand	Length"

The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:

The user asked the following question:
### QUERY
 which genes are differentially expressed?

You generated the following Python code:
import pandas as pd
sql_query = """
SELECT gene_name 
FROM table_aa46becb7fdcb4e370e7817206649059 
WHERE padj < 0.05
"""
df = execute_sql_query(sql_query)
result = {'type': 'dataframe', 'value': df}

However, it resulted in the following error:

You are already provided with the following functions that you can call:
<function>
def execute_sql_query(sql_query: str) -> pd.Dataframe
    """This method connects to the database, executes the sql query and returns the dataframe"""
</function>


Update this initial code:
```python
# TODO: import the required dependencies
import pandas as pd

# Write code here

# Declare result var: 
type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot"). Examples: { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." } or { "type": "number", "value": 125 } or { "type": "dataframe", "value": pd.DataFrame({...}) } or { "type": "plot", "value": "temp_chart.png" }

```



### QUERY
 give me the top 3 upregulated genes in terms of adjusted p-value

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.


Generate python code and return full updated code:

### Note: Use only relevant table for query and do aggregation, sorting, joins and grouby through sql query

The user asked the following question:
### QUERY
 give me the top 3 upregulated genes in terms of adjusted p-value

You generated the following Python code:
import pandas as pd
sql_query = "SELECT * FROM table_aa46becb7fdcb4e370e7817206649059 WHERE Significance = 'up' ORDER BY padj LIMIT 3"
df = execute_sql_query(sql_query)
result = {'type': 'dataframe', 'value': df}

However, it resulted in the following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/miniconda3/envs/omics_agent/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pandasai/agent/base.py", line 136, in _execute_local_sql_query

duckdb.duckdb.BinderException: Binder Error: Referenced column "Significance" not found in FROM clause!
Candidate bindings: "gene_name	baseMean	log2FoldChange	pvalue	padj	Significance	Geneid	Chr	Start	End	Strand	Length"

The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:

The user asked the following question:
### QUERY
 give me the top 3 upregulated genes in terms of adjusted p-value

You generated the following Python code:
import pandas as pd
sql_query = 'SELECT * FROM table_aa46becb7fdcb4e370e7817206649059 ORDER BY padj LIMIT 3'
df = execute_sql_query(sql_query)
result = {'type': 'dataframe', 'value': df}

However, it resulted in the following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/miniconda3/envs/omics_agent/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pandasai/agent/base.py", line 136, in _execute_local_sql_query

Candidate bindings: "gene_name	baseMean	log2FoldChange	pvalue	padj	Significance	Geneid	Chr	Start	End	Strand	Length"

The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:

The user asked the following question:
### QUERY
 give me the top 3 upregulated genes in terms of adjusted p-value

You generated the following Python code:
import pandas as pd
sql_query = 'SELECT * FROM table_aa46becb7fdcb4e370e7817206649059 WHERE Significance = "up" ORDER BY padj ASC LIMIT 3'
df = execute_sql_query(sql_query)
result = {'type': 'dataframe', 'value': df}

However, it resulted in the following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):

duckdb.duckdb.BinderException: Binder Error: Referenced column "Significance" not found in FROM clause!

The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:

def execute_sql_query(sql_query: str) -> pd.Dataframe
    """This method connects to the database, executes the sql query and returns the dataframe"""
</function>


Update this initial code:
```python
# TODO: import the required dependencies
import pandas as pd

# Write code here

# Declare result var: 
type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot"). Examples: { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." } or { "type": "number", "value": 125 } or { "type": "dataframe", "value": pd.DataFrame({...}) } or { "type": "plot", "value": "temp_chart.png" }

```



### QUERY
 Who gets paid the most?

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.

You are already provided with the following functions that you can call:
<function>
def execute_sql_query(sql_query: str) -> pd.Dataframe
    """This method connects to the database, executes the sql query and returns the dataframe"""
</function>


Update this initial code:
```python
# TODO: import the required dependencies
import pandas as pd

# Write code here

# Declare result var: 
type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot"). Examples: { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." } or { "type": "number", "value": 125 } or { "type": "dataframe", "value": pd.DataFrame({...}) } or { "type": "plot", "value": "temp_chart.png" }

```



### QUERY
 What are the top 10 genes with the highest log2FoldChange?

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.


Generate python code and return full updated code:

### Note: Use only relevant table for query and do aggregation, sorting, joins and grouby through sql query

<function>
def execute_sql_query(sql_query: str) -> pd.Dataframe
    """This method connects to the database, executes the sql query and returns the dataframe"""
</function>


Update this initial code:
```python
# TODO: import the required dependencies
import pandas as pd

# Write code here

# Declare result var: 
type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot"). Examples: { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." } or { "type": "number", "value": 125 } or { "type": "dataframe", "value": pd.DataFrame({...}) } or { "type": "plot", "value": "temp_chart.png" }

```



### QUERY
 What are the top 10 genes with the highest log2FoldChange and what strand are they on?

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.


Generate python code and return full updated code:

You are already provided with the following functions that you can call:
<function>
def execute_sql_query(sql_query: str) -> pd.Dataframe
    """This method connects to the database, executes the sql query and returns the dataframe"""
</function>


Update this initial code:
```python
# TODO: import the required dependencies
import pandas as pd

# Write code here

# Declare result var: 
type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot"). Examples: { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." } or { "type": "number", "value": 125 } or { "type": "dataframe", "value": pd.DataFrame({...}) } or { "type": "plot", "value": "temp_chart.png" }

```



### QUERY
 What are the top 10 genes with the highest log2FoldChange and what strand are they on?

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.


Generate python code and return full updated code:

# Write code here

# Declare result var: 
type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot"). Examples: { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." } or { "type": "number", "value": 125 } or { "type": "dataframe", "value": pd.DataFrame({...}) } or { "type": "plot", "value": "temp_chart.png" }

```



### QUERY
 what 3 genes have lowest log fold change and what is their ensembl gene id?

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.

You are already provided with the following functions that you can call:
<function>
def execute_sql_query(sql_query: str) -> pd.Dataframe
    """This method connects to the database, executes the sql query and returns the dataframe"""
</function>


Update this initial code:
```python
# TODO: import the required dependencies
import pandas as pd

# Write code here

# Declare result var: 
type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot"). Examples: { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." } or { "type": "number", "value": 125 } or { "type": "dataframe", "value": pd.DataFrame({...}) } or { "type": "plot", "value": "temp_chart.png" }

```



### QUERY
 what has the highest mean?

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.


Generate python code and return full updated code:
