def execute_sql_query(sql_query: str) -> pd.Dataframe
    """This method connects to the database, executes the sql query and returns the dataframe"""
</function>


Update this initial code:
```python
# TODO: import the required dependencies
import pandas as pd

# Write code here

# Declare result var: 
type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot"). Examples: { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." } or { "type": "number", "value": 125 } or { "type": "dataframe", "value": pd.DataFrame({...}) } or { "type": "plot", "value": "temp_chart.png" }

```



### QUERY
 what is the expression of CATG00000000004.1 in the pma24 samples?

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.


Generate python code and return full updated code:

The user asked the following question:
### QUERY
 what is the expression of CATG00000000004.1 in the pma24 samples?

You generated the following Python code:
import pandas as pd
sql_query = 'SELECT * FROM table_06e71d5c8f207b1f32443a2f663431df WHERE gene_name = "CATG00000000004.1"'
df = execute_sql_query(sql_query)
pma24_samples = df.filter(regex='pma24')
result = {'type': 'dataframe', 'value': pma24_samples}
result

However, it resulted in the following error:

The user asked the following question:
### QUERY
 what is the expression of CATG00000000004.1 in the pma24 samples?

You generated the following Python code:
import pandas as pd
sql_query = 'SELECT * FROM table_06e71d5c8f207b1f32443a2f663431df WHERE gene_name = "CATG00000000004.1"'
df = execute_sql_query(sql_query)
pma24_samples = df.filter(regex='pma24')
result = {'type': 'dataframe', 'value': pma24_samples}
result

However, it resulted in the following error:

The user asked the following question:
### QUERY
 what is the expression of CATG00000000004.1 in the pma24 samples?

You generated the following Python code:
import pandas as pd
sql_query = 'SELECT * FROM table_06e71d5c8f207b1f32443a2f663431df WHERE gene_name = "CATG00000000004.1"'
df = execute_sql_query(sql_query)
pma24_samples = df.filter(regex='pma24')
result = {'type': 'dataframe', 'value': pma24_samples}
result

However, it resulted in the following error:

Update this initial code:
```python
# TODO: import the required dependencies
import pandas as pd

# Write code here

# Declare result var: 
type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot"). Examples: { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." } or { "type": "number", "value": 125 } or { "type": "dataframe", "value": pd.DataFrame({...}) } or { "type": "plot", "value": "temp_chart.png" }

```



### QUERY
 what is the expression of CATG00000000004.1 for _pma24_ compared to _pma96_?

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.


Generate python code and return full updated code:

def execute_sql_query(sql_query: str) -> pd.Dataframe
    """This method connects to the database, executes the sql query and returns the dataframe"""
</function>


Update this initial code:
```python
# TODO: import the required dependencies
import pandas as pd

# Write code here

# Declare result var: 
type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot"). Examples: { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." } or { "type": "number", "value": 125 } or { "type": "dataframe", "value": pd.DataFrame({...}) } or { "type": "plot", "value": "temp_chart.png" }

```



### QUERY
 which genes are differentially expressed?

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.


Generate python code and return full updated code:

The user asked the following question:
### QUERY
 which genes are differentially expressed?

You generated the following Python code:
import pandas as pd
sql_query = "SELECT gene_name, Significance FROM table_aa46becb7fdcb4e370e7817206649059 WHERE Significance = 'down' OR Significance = 'up'"
df = execute_sql_query(sql_query)
result = {'type': 'dataframe', 'value': df}

However, it resulted in the following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):

The user asked the following question:
### QUERY
 which genes are differentially expressed?

You generated the following Python code:
import pandas as pd
table_aa46becb7fdcb4e370e7817206649059 = table_aa46becb7fdcb4e370e7817206649059.replace('\t', ',')
sql_query = "SELECT gene_name, Significance FROM table_aa46becb7fdcb4e370e7817206649059 WHERE Significance = 'down' OR Significance = 'up'"
df = execute_sql_query(sql_query)
result = {'type': 'dataframe', 'value': df}

However, it resulted in the following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/miniconda3/envs/omics_agent/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pandasai/core/code_execution/code_executor.py", line 29, in execute

  File "<string>", line 2, in <module>
NameError: name 'table_aa46becb7fdcb4e370e7817206649059' is not defined

The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/miniconda3/envs/omics_agent/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pandasai/agent/base.py", line 169, in execute_with_retries

    raise CodeExecutionError("Code execution failed") from e
pandasai.exceptions.CodeExecutionError: Code execution failed


Fix the python code above and return the new python code but the code generated should use execute_sql_query function

# Write code here

# Declare result var: 
type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot"). Examples: { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." } or { "type": "number", "value": 125 } or { "type": "dataframe", "value": pd.DataFrame({...}) } or { "type": "plot", "value": "temp_chart.png" }

```



### QUERY
 which genes are differentially expressed?

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.


Generate python code and return full updated code:

The user asked the following question:
### QUERY
 which genes are differentially expressed?

You generated the following Python code:
import pandas as pd
sql_query = """
SELECT gene_name 
FROM table_aa46becb7fdcb4e370e7817206649059 
WHERE Significance = 'down'
"""
df = execute_sql_query(sql_query)
result = {'type': 'dataframe', 'value': df}

However, it resulted in the following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/miniconda3/envs/omics_agent/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pandasai/agent/base.py", line 136, in _execute_local_sql_query

duckdb.duckdb.BinderException: Binder Error: Referenced column "Significance" not found in FROM clause!
Candidate bindings: "gene_name	baseMean	log2FoldChange	pvalue	padj	Significance	Geneid	Chr	Start	End	Strand	Length"

The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:

The user asked the following question:
### QUERY
 which genes are differentially expressed?

You generated the following Python code:
import pandas as pd
sql_query = """
SELECT gene_name 
FROM table_aa46becb7fdcb4e370e7817206649059 
WHERE padj < 0.05
"""
df = execute_sql_query(sql_query)
result = {'type': 'dataframe', 'value': df}

However, it resulted in the following error:

You are already provided with the following functions that you can call:
<function>
def execute_sql_query(sql_query: str) -> pd.Dataframe
    """This method connects to the database, executes the sql query and returns the dataframe"""
</function>


Update this initial code:
```python
# TODO: import the required dependencies
import pandas as pd

# Write code here

# Declare result var: 
type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot"). Examples: { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." } or { "type": "number", "value": 125 } or { "type": "dataframe", "value": pd.DataFrame({...}) } or { "type": "plot", "value": "temp_chart.png" }

```



### QUERY
 give me the top 3 upregulated genes in terms of adjusted p-value

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.


Generate python code and return full updated code:

### Note: Use only relevant table for query and do aggregation, sorting, joins and grouby through sql query

The user asked the following question:
### QUERY
 give me the top 3 upregulated genes in terms of adjusted p-value

You generated the following Python code:
import pandas as pd
sql_query = "SELECT * FROM table_aa46becb7fdcb4e370e7817206649059 WHERE Significance = 'up' ORDER BY padj LIMIT 3"
df = execute_sql_query(sql_query)
result = {'type': 'dataframe', 'value': df}

However, it resulted in the following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/miniconda3/envs/omics_agent/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pandasai/agent/base.py", line 136, in _execute_local_sql_query

duckdb.duckdb.BinderException: Binder Error: Referenced column "Significance" not found in FROM clause!
Candidate bindings: "gene_name	baseMean	log2FoldChange	pvalue	padj	Significance	Geneid	Chr	Start	End	Strand	Length"

The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:

The user asked the following question:
### QUERY
 give me the top 3 upregulated genes in terms of adjusted p-value

You generated the following Python code:
import pandas as pd
sql_query = 'SELECT * FROM table_aa46becb7fdcb4e370e7817206649059 ORDER BY padj LIMIT 3'
df = execute_sql_query(sql_query)
result = {'type': 'dataframe', 'value': df}

However, it resulted in the following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/opt/miniconda3/envs/omics_agent/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pandasai/agent/base.py", line 136, in _execute_local_sql_query

Candidate bindings: "gene_name	baseMean	log2FoldChange	pvalue	padj	Significance	Geneid	Chr	Start	End	Strand	Length"

The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:

The user asked the following question:
### QUERY
 give me the top 3 upregulated genes in terms of adjusted p-value

You generated the following Python code:
import pandas as pd
sql_query = 'SELECT * FROM table_aa46becb7fdcb4e370e7817206649059 WHERE Significance = "up" ORDER BY padj ASC LIMIT 3'
df = execute_sql_query(sql_query)
result = {'type': 'dataframe', 'value': df}

However, it resulted in the following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):

duckdb.duckdb.BinderException: Binder Error: Referenced column "Significance" not found in FROM clause!

The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:

def execute_sql_query(sql_query: str) -> pd.Dataframe
    """This method connects to the database, executes the sql query and returns the dataframe"""
</function>


Update this initial code:
```python
# TODO: import the required dependencies
import pandas as pd

# Write code here

# Declare result var: 
type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot"). Examples: { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." } or { "type": "number", "value": 125 } or { "type": "dataframe", "value": pd.DataFrame({...}) } or { "type": "plot", "value": "temp_chart.png" }

```



### QUERY
 Who gets paid the most?

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.

You are already provided with the following functions that you can call:
<function>
def execute_sql_query(sql_query: str) -> pd.Dataframe
    """This method connects to the database, executes the sql query and returns the dataframe"""
</function>


Update this initial code:
```python
# TODO: import the required dependencies
import pandas as pd

# Write code here

# Declare result var: 
type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot"). Examples: { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." } or { "type": "number", "value": 125 } or { "type": "dataframe", "value": pd.DataFrame({...}) } or { "type": "plot", "value": "temp_chart.png" }

```



### QUERY
 What are the top 10 genes with the highest log2FoldChange?

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.


Generate python code and return full updated code:

### Note: Use only relevant table for query and do aggregation, sorting, joins and grouby through sql query

<function>
def execute_sql_query(sql_query: str) -> pd.Dataframe
    """This method connects to the database, executes the sql query and returns the dataframe"""
</function>


Update this initial code:
```python
# TODO: import the required dependencies
import pandas as pd

# Write code here

# Declare result var: 
type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot"). Examples: { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." } or { "type": "number", "value": 125 } or { "type": "dataframe", "value": pd.DataFrame({...}) } or { "type": "plot", "value": "temp_chart.png" }

```



### QUERY
 What are the top 10 genes with the highest log2FoldChange and what strand are they on?

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.


Generate python code and return full updated code:

You are already provided with the following functions that you can call:
<function>
def execute_sql_query(sql_query: str) -> pd.Dataframe
    """This method connects to the database, executes the sql query and returns the dataframe"""
</function>


Update this initial code:
```python
# TODO: import the required dependencies
import pandas as pd

# Write code here

# Declare result var: 
type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot"). Examples: { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." } or { "type": "number", "value": 125 } or { "type": "dataframe", "value": pd.DataFrame({...}) } or { "type": "plot", "value": "temp_chart.png" }

```



### QUERY
 What are the top 10 genes with the highest log2FoldChange and what strand are they on?

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.


Generate python code and return full updated code:

# Write code here

# Declare result var: 
type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot"). Examples: { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." } or { "type": "number", "value": 125 } or { "type": "dataframe", "value": pd.DataFrame({...}) } or { "type": "plot", "value": "temp_chart.png" }

```



### QUERY
 what 3 genes have lowest log fold change and what is their ensembl gene id?

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.

You are already provided with the following functions that you can call:
<function>
def execute_sql_query(sql_query: str) -> pd.Dataframe
    """This method connects to the database, executes the sql query and returns the dataframe"""
</function>


Update this initial code:
```python
# TODO: import the required dependencies
import pandas as pd

# Write code here

# Declare result var: 
type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot"). Examples: { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." } or { "type": "number", "value": 125 } or { "type": "dataframe", "value": pd.DataFrame({...}) } or { "type": "plot", "value": "temp_chart.png" }

```



### QUERY
 what has the highest mean?

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.


Generate python code and return full updated code:

    df = execute_sql_query(sql_query)
    return df

The user asked the following question:
### QUERY
 in which sample is OR4G11P most expressed?

You generated the following Python code:
import pandas as pd
sql_query = "SELECT gene_name, MAX(s17,s16,s20,s23,s18,s26,s19,s27,s21,s22,s24,s11,s2,s25,s3,s4,s5,s13,s7,s6,s8,s10,s14,s9,s12,s1,s15) as max_expression FROM table_ff283d5a2a4a86a75db496d43ff594db WHERE gene_name = 'OR4G11P'"
df = execute_sql_query(sql_query)
most_expressed_sample = df.columns[df.iloc[0] == df.iloc[0].max()][0]
result = {'type': 'string', 'value': f'OR4G11P is most expressed in {most_expressed_sample}.'}

However, it resulted in the following error:

The user asked the following question:
### QUERY
 what pathway is most enriched?

You generated the following Python code:
import pandas as pd


def get_most_enriched_pathway():
    sql_query = 'SELECT Description, MAX(enrichmentScore) as max_enrichmentScore FROM table_24f2591640ef1dfb4879f5504315a266'
    df = execute_sql_query(sql_query)
    most_enriched_pathway = df.loc[0, 'Description']
    return most_enriched_pathway


most_enriched_pathway = get_most_enriched_pathway()
result = {'type': 'string', 'value': f'The most enriched pathway is {most_enriched_pathway}.'}

However, it resulted in the following error:

    """This method connects to the database, executes the sql query and returns the dataframe"""
</function>


Update this initial code:
```python
# TODO: import the required dependencies
import pandas as pd

# Write code here

# Declare result var: 
type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot"). Examples: { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." } or { "type": "number", "value": 125 } or { "type": "dataframe", "value": pd.DataFrame({...}) } or { "type": "plot", "value": "temp_chart.png" }

```



### QUERY
 on what chromosomes are the 5 most significantly expressed genes?

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.


Generate python code and return full updated code:

### Note: Use only relevant table for query and do aggregation, sorting, joins and grouby through sql query

You generated the following Python code:
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
sql_query = 'SELECT PC8, PC9, Patient FROM table_0e72b0a26a315cc49e32a3907cf9cc75'
df = execute_sql_query(sql_query)
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
scatter = ax.scatter(df['PC8'], df['PC9'], c=df['Patient'], cmap='viridis')
legend1 = ax.legend(*scatter.legend_elements(), title='Patients')
ax.add_artist(legend1)
plt.xlabel('PC8')
plt.ylabel('PC9')
plt.title('PC8 vs PC9 colored by patient')
plt.savefig('exports/charts/temp_chart_1912158d-3afd-4365-8690-6afdfed25e6f.png')
result = {'type': 'plot', 'value': 'exports/charts/temp_chart_1912158d-3afd-4365-8690-6afdfed25e6f.png'}

# The limitations of PCA are:

# 3. PCA is not scale-invariant. The results can be influenced by the scale of the features.

# 4. PCA assumes that the data is normally distributed. If the data is not normally distributed, PCA may not give the best results.

# 5. PCA only considers the variance of the data, and does not take into account any correlation between the features.

# 6. PCA is sensitive to outliers. If the data contains outliers, they can significantly influence the results of PCA.

# 7. PCA is not interpretable. The principal components are not easy to interpret in terms of the original features.
