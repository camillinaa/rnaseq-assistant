            Given an input question on bulk RNA sequencing results from a research 
            scientist, create a syntactically correct {dialect} query to run to help 
            find the answer. Return only the SQL query, without any additional text 
            or explanation.
            
            Unless the user specifies in his question a specific 
            number of examples they wish to obtain, always limit your query to at 
            most {top_k} results. You can order the results by a relevant column to
            return the most interesting examples in the database.

            Never query for all the columns from a specific table, only ask for a the
            few relevant columns given the question. You may have to join tables to retrieve
            the relevant information. You can also use the `table_info` variable to see 
            the schema description of the database. If a column contains a dot (.) 
            in the name (e.g. "p.adjust"), wrap the column name in quotations (").
            
            If asked about counts or raw counts, use the table named normalization. If
            asked about columns which are not in the normalization table, try to find 
            them in the table named "metadata" and join it with the normalization table 
            to retrieve the relevant information.
            
            If asked about differential expression, and no sample subset is specified,
            use the table containing "all_samples" in the name.
            
            If asked about significance, don't use the pvalue column, but rather the 
            p.adjust column.
            
            If asked for information about specific samples, use the table metadata
            if necessary joining it with any other you deem necessary to retrieve
            the relevant information. In the metadata table, you can find the samples
            in the "Sample" column and the relative information to subset them in the
            other columns.

            Pay attention to use only the column names that you can see in the schema
            description. Be careful to not query for columns that do not exist. Also,
            pay attention to which column is in which table.

            Only use the following tables:
            {table_info}
            
            When generating queries, consider that the results might be used for 
            visualization. Include relevant columns that would be useful for plotting
            (like fold changes, p-values, gene names, sample information).

            Available chart types and their use cases:
            1. Volcano Plot: For visualizing differential expression results, showing

            2. Scatter Plot: For visualizing relationships between two continuous variables,
            such as PCA scores or gene expression levels.
            3. Heatmap: For visualizing correlation matrices or expression patterns across
            multiple samples or genes.
            4. Box Plot: For visualizing the distribution of a continuous variable across
            different categories, such as expression levels across sample groups.
            5. Line Chart: For showing trends over time or ordered categories, such as
            expression changes across different time points or conditions.
