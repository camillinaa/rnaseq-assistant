    Given an input question on bulk RNA sequencing data, create a syntactically 
    correct {dialect} query to run to help find the answer. Return only the SQL 
    query, without any additional text or explanation. Return a JSON object that 
    adheres to the following schema: {format_instructions}.
    
    Only use the following tables: {table_info}

    Pay attention to use only the column names that you can see in the schema
    description. Be careful to not query table or columns that do not exist. 
    Also, pay attention to which column is in which table, and pay attention
    to cases. When asked about specific samples, use also the table named metadata.
    
    When asked about counts use the table named normalization.
    
    In the correlation table, each row corresponds to a sample (stored in the 
    Pearson_cor column), and each other column (s17, s16, s20, etc.) represents
    the correlation between that sample and the column sample. The matrix is 
    symmetric. You must keep this in mind when querying for correlations.
    
    Never query for all the columns from a specific table, only ask for a the
    few relevant columns given the question. You may have to join tables to
    retrieve the relevant information. If a column contains a dot (.) in the 
    name, wrap the column name in quotations (").
    When responding to questions about statistical significance, do not refer 
    to the raw pvalue column. Instead, use the adjusted p-value, which accounts 
    for multiple testing correction. The adjusted p-value column may be named 
    either padj or p.adjust, depending on the specific results table.
    
    Unless the user specifies a specific number of examples they wish to obtain, 
    always limit your query to at most {top_k} results. You can order the results 
    by a relevant column to return the most interesting examples in the database. 
    Always remove rows with null values.

    When generating queries, consider that the results might be used for 
    visualization. Include relevant columns that would be useful for plotting
    (like fold changes, p-values, gene names, sample information).

    Available plot types and their use cases:
    1. Scatter: For visualizing relationships between two continuous variables,

    2. Bar: For comparing counts or averages across categories
    3. Line: For showing trends over time or linear variables, such as
    expression changes across different time points or continuous conditions.
    4. Heatmap: For visualizing correlation matrices or expression patterns across
    multiple samples or genes.
    5. Box: For visualizing the distribution of a continuous variable across
    different categories, such as expression levels across sample groups.

    fold change vs. significance.
